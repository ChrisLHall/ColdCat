Idea: You are a young girl who has lost her cat somewhere in the caves of ice.
It is an overhead view motherload-like grid of ice blocks, with a cave carved out of it.
Some of the ice blocks are dark because they contain things.
 your job is to dig through the ice blocks before you run out of food, in order
to find your cat.

Your cat is one of the dark blocks. It meows from time to time so you can get an idea
of haow far away it is

maybe in 3d with huge ice blocks. Sometimes they contain stairs.


your character is a dog
2d gameboy graphics - four colors (white, black, darkblue, lightbluegreen)
you have a food meter that depletes when you walk and break ice
many status effects change how much it costs to walk and break ice
e.g. fire breath = barely any cost to break ic

air pockets in the ice that burst all at once if an adjacent block is destroyed.
cannot be seen form afar
